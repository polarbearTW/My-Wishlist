We are creating an app 
where we can save our favourite locations.
(or whatever, places we want to go, etc.. just a list of locations)

Inside of our HTML files, templates:
- The only PHP code you can write are:
    1- Creating variables
    2- Call functions
    3- Include files
    4- You can loop
    5- You can use conditional statements

Field ideas: 
    - * Name of place
    - District
    - Notes / Comment
    - Address (free format vs street name / city / country / postal code)
    - Coordinates (longitude & latitude)
    - Personal Rating
    - Price (if there is a set admission fee or similar)
    - Price range
    - Pictures
    - Date visited
